## Content Type model relation to Comment

To enable Content Type to work with Comments, you've to add following field to your model `*.settings.json`:

```
    "comments": {
      "plugin": "comments",
      "collection": "comment",
      "via": "related"
    }
```

inside the `attributes` section like in example below:

```
    "attributes": {
        ...,
        "comments": {
            "plugin": "comments",
            "collection": "comment",
            "via": "related"
        },
        ...
    },
```

## Configuration

```
    ...
    plugins: {
      comments: {
        enableUsers: true,
        badWords: false,
      },
    },
    ...
```
